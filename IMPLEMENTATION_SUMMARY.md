# Lambda Cron Node Processor â€“ Migration Summary

## Goals Delivered
- Replaced all direct MongoDB dependencies with REST API calls surfaced through the shared Brace client wrapper
- Normalised the Lambda entry point to the standard event pattern (`nodeId`/`userId` payload)
- Preserved the existing scraping, description, and embedding logic while routing persistence through API endpoints
- Added CodeBuild deployment assets, updated test harnesses, and refreshed documentation

## Key Changes by Area

### Handler & Orchestration
- `lambda_handler.py` now boots a singleton `NodeProcessor`, extracts identifiers from the event body, and returns uniform success/error payloads.
- `processor.py` coordinates node retrieval (`GET /api/nodes/{id}`), HTML downloads from R2, the scraping pipeline, and error signalling (`POST /api/nodes/mark-error`).

### Client & Configuration
- `config/settings.py` removes Mongo settings and introduces REST tuning knobs (`BASE_API_URL`, `INSIGHTS_API_KEY`, retry/timeout controls).
- `clients.py` exposes an `ApiClient` with retry-aware `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE` helpers plus R2, Upstash Vector, and Redis clients for downstream modules.

### Business Logic Modules
- `bs/parseHtmlForDescription.py` delegates CRUD actions to API routes: searching duplicates (`POST /api/nodes/search-by-user`), updating nodes (`PATCH /api/nodes/{id}`), deleting duplicates (`DELETE /api/nodes/{id}`), and marking errors.
- `bs/db.py` now resolves webpage identifiers via `POST /api/webpages/get-or-create` and re-exports shared Upstash clients.
- `bs/generate_description.py` sources company metadata through `GET /api/webpages/by-url` and `POST /api/webpages/search` rather than scanning Mongo collections.
- `bs/createVectors.py` no longer instantiates `ObjectId` instances; all references are handled as strings.

### Tooling & Docs
- Added `buildspec.yml` mirroring platform conventions with `LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME=lambda-cron-node-processor`.
- Replaced legacy network-capital README/summary with cron-node specific guidance.
- Updated `test_lambda.py` and `test_local.py` to exercise the new handler and REST dependencies (expects mocked APIs for local runs).

## Validation Notes
- Static bytecode compile (`python3 -m compileall`) was attempted but denied by macOS sandbox permissions; no syntax issues observed before the permission error surfaced.
- Full end-to-end execution requires live API endpoints or mocks. The included harnesses demonstrate invocation shape and environment prerequisites.

## Follow-Up
1. Wire the documented API routes (`nodes.getById`, `nodes.updateProfile`, `webpages.getOrCreate`, etc.) to backend implementations or stubs.
2. Configure AWS Lambda environment variables listed in the README before deployment.
3. After backend alignment, run the smoke test (`python test_lambda.py`) to confirm success responses.

The cron node processor lambda is now structurally aligned with the Brace microservice standards and ready for backend API hookups.

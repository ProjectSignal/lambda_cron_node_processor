WED_USER_PROMPT = """You are an expert recruiter tasked with creating a comprehensive professional summary based on a detailed profile. Your goal is to produce a summary that captures the essence of the individual's career, education, and key accomplishments in a way that would be valuable for potential employers or professional connections.

Here is the profile you need to analyze:

{{profile}}

Please follow these steps to create your summary:

1. Carefully read through the entire profile, paying attention to all sections including work experience, education, accomplishments, recommendations, and personal statements.

2. In your analysis, consider the following aspects:
   - Current role(s) and responsibilities, including any concurrent positions
   - Educational background and its relevance to career progression
   - Quantifiable achievements (specific metrics, percentages, improvements)
   - Technical skills and areas of expertise
   - Soft skills and personal qualities mentioned in recommendations
   - Geographic experience and mobility preferences
   - Professional development activities and recognition
   - Career trajectory and growth pattern

3. Organize your findings within <profile_breakdown> tags, including:
   - Current Professional Status
     * Present role(s) and responsibilities
     * Concurrent positions if any
     * Most recent educational achievement
   
   - Career Achievements
     * Quantifiable metrics and improvements
     * Project successes and innovations
     * Recognition and awards
   
   - Technical Expertise
     * Core technical skills
     * Industry-specific knowledge
     * Tools and methodologies
   
   - Professional Development
     * Certifications and training
     * Professional memberships
     * Continuing education
   
   - Personal Attributes
     * Key qualities from recommendations
     * Adaptability and mobility
     * Leadership and team capabilities

4. Based on your analysis, create a comprehensive professional summary structured in four paragraphs:
   
   Paragraph 1: Current professional status, including present role(s) and educational background
   
   Paragraph 2: Key achievements and experience, with specific metrics and results
   
   Paragraph 3: Professional development, certifications, and recognition
   
   Paragraph 4: Value proposition to potential employers, including adaptability and future potential

Your summary should:
- Be approximately 250-300 words
- Lead with current status and most relevant qualifications
- Include specific metrics and quantifiable achievements
- Integrate both technical capabilities and soft skills
- Highlight geographic experience and mobility when relevant
- Conclude with a clear value proposition for potential employers
- Maintain a professional tone while conveying personality and drive

5. Present your final summary within <output> tags like below:

<output>
<!-- Professional summary will be generated here -->
</output>

Remember that this summary will be used to evaluate and rank the individual against other candidates, so ensure it effectively communicates their unique value proposition and potential impact in future roles.
